# NEURAL NETS GLOSSARY
# ==============================================================================

word:
  title: Word
  text: A word is a single distinct meaningful element of speech or writing. 

receptive-field:
  title: Receptive field
  text: The receptive field of a neuron is the set of neurons whose values
    contribute to that neuron's value, based on the architecture of the neural network.
    For example, the receptive field of a neuron in a dense layer includes the entire
    preceding layer, while the receptive field of a neuron in a convolutional
    or subsampling layer is typically much smaller. 
    
int:
  title: int
  text: the standard integer type in Python
  
float:
  title: float
  text: the standard Python type for floating point numbers

str:
  title: str
  text: | 
    The standard Python type for textual data
    
    _{pre}myString = "Hello world!"
    myString[0] # returns "H"
    myString[3:] # returns "lo world!"
    dir(str) # to see all of the string methods_

list:
  title: List
  text: |
    A mutable data type for storing an ordered sequence of objects. 
    
    _{pre}L = [5, "Hello", "world", 
         6, [1,2,3]]
    L[0] # returns 5
    L[4][1] # returns 2_

listcomp:
  title: List Comprehension
  text: |
    Special syntax for generating lists by mapping and filtering. To remove the elements of _{code}L_ not satisfying a condition _{code}cond_ and apply a function _{code}f_ to the remaining elements:
    
    _{pre}[f(x) for x in L if cond(x)]_
    
    The _{code}if_ clause may be omitted.
    
    _{pre}[x**2 for x in range(5) 
            if x % 2 == 0]_
            
    returns _{code}[0, 4, 16]_

tuple:
  title: tuple
  text: |
    An immutable data type for storing an ordered sequence of objects. 
    
    _{pre}T = (5, "Hello", "world", 
         6, (1,2,3))
    T[0] # returns 5
    T[4][1] # returns 2_

function:
  title: function
  text: | 
    A packaged block of related code for performing a specific computation or action. Values to be input are called **parameters**, and they can be given default values:
    
    _{pre}def add(x, y, z=0):
        return x + y + z_

    _{pre}add(3,2) # returns 5
    add(3,2,z=7) # returns 12_

dictionary:
  title: Dictionary
  text: | 
    An unordered, mutable data type used for encoding a function whose domain is a finite set
  
    For example, if we set 
    
    _{code}D = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}_, 
    
    then the expression _{code}D['b']_ returns _{code}2_. 
    
method:
  title: method
  text: |
    A function associated with a specific class and called using dot syntax from an instance of that class
    
    For exapmle, in _{code}",".join([1,2,3])_, _{code}","_ is a string and _{code}join_ is a method of the string class.
