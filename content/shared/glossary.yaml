receptive-field:
  title: Receptive field
  text: The receptive field of a neuron is the set of neurons whose values
    contribute to that neuron's value, based on the architecture of the neural network.
    For example, the receptive field of a neuron in a dense layer includes the entire
    preceding layer, while the receptive field of a neuron in a convolutional
    or subsampling layer is typically much smaller.
