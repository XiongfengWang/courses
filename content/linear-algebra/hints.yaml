any-shape: Can the span of two vectors be a circle, for example?
line-or-point: What if the two vectors don't point in the same direction?
circle: Can it really be a circle? For every line through the origin, it has to contain either the whole line or just the point at the origin.
sphere: Can it really be a sphere? For every line through the origin, it has to contain either the whole line or just the point at the origin.
plane: What if the third vector points in a direction which is not in the plane spanned by the first two?
too-few: Can the intersection have such a small dimension? Consider two planes intersecting in three-dimensional space.
too-many: Can the intersection have a larger dimension than the larger-dimensional space being intersected?
less-five: Did you really get results less than five?
all-fives: Try running it more times.
parallel-span: If two vectors are parallel, can they span the plane?
two-span-space: What is the largest geometric shape that two vectors can span?
mat-inv-order: Try making a little sketch and applying the transformations in that order
orthogonal-every: What if v is an eigenvector of A?
always-lin-dep: Consider the vector [0,1] in the butterfly figure above.
